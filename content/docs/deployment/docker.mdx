This deployment method requires you to be familiar with basic Docker usage and have production environment variables ready (database and third-party services). The project includes a built-in Dockerfile — just follow these steps to deploy.

```bash title="Build the image"
docker build -t vibe-any-tanstack .
```

```bash title="Run the container"
docker run -p 3000:3000 vibe-any-tanstack
```

```bash title="Run in detached mode (background)"
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name vibe-any-tanstack vibe-any-tanstack
```
