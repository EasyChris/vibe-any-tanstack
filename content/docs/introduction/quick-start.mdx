## Prerequisites

<div className="fd-steps">
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### 1. Node.js
    Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code locally.
    If not installed, macOS users can install it via brew:
    ```bash
    brew install node
    ```

    Or download the LTS version from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

    After installation, verify by checking the version (v20.19.0 or above is recommended):
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```

  </div>
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### 2. Git
    Git is a version control tool for tracking code history and collaborating.

    macOS users can install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (Git is included with Xcode).

    Or download from the [Git official website](https://git-scm.com/).

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### 3. Package Manager
    Used to install dependencies. We recommend <code>pnpm</code>, but you can also use <code>npm</code>, <code>bun</code>, or <code>yarn</code>.

    ```bash
    # Install pnpm via npm
    npm install -g pnpm
    # Check version
    pnpm -v
    ```
  </div>
</div>

> Tip: If you'd like a better terminal experience, try [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) — it supports multiple tabs, themes, command completion, and more.

    ### 1. Clone the Project
    <p>Download the repository to your local machine. You can replace <code>vibe-any</code> with any folder name.</p>
    <p>Don't want to use Git? You can download the ZIP directly:</p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/待修改/main.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Download ZIP</a>
    </p>

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/待修改/vibe-any.git
    cd vibe-any
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="fd-step" >

  <div className="fd-step" >
    ### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
    <p><code>.env</code> stores the variables needed to run the project (e.g., database, third-party service keys). Copy the example file first, then fill in the values following the comments.</p>

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  </div>
</div>

> Tip: Common variables include <code>DATABASE_URL</code>, OAuth (GitHub/Google) configuration, and payment-related keys. See the [Environment Variables](../03-environment) documentation for details.
