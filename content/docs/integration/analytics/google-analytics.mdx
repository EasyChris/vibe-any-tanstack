description: Add Google Analytics to track page views and user behavior

Vibe Any has built-in support for [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/). When configured, the gtag script is automatically injected into every page.

## Setup

<div className="fd-steps">
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### Create a Google Analytics Property

    Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and create a new property. After setup, you'll get a **Measurement ID** in the format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`.
  </div>
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### Set Environment Variable

    Add your Measurement ID to `.env.local`:

    ```bash
    VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
    ```
  </div>
  <div className="fd-step">
    ### Deploy

    That's it. The analytics script is automatically loaded when `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is set. No code changes needed.
  </div>
</div>

## How It Works

The integration is in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. When the environment variable is present, two script tags are injected into `<head>`:

1. The Google gtag.js loader
2. The initialization script that configures your Measurement ID

```tsx
{import.meta.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID && (
  <>
    <script
      async
      src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${import.meta.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}`}
    />
    <script
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        __html: `window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}gtag('js',new Date());gtag('config','${import.meta.env.VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID}');`,
      }}
    />
  </>
)}
```

If `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is not set, no analytics script is loaded — zero overhead.

## Verify

After deployment, open your site and check the **Realtime** report in Google Analytics to confirm data is flowing.

You can also open browser DevTools → Network tab and look for requests to `googletagmanager.com`.
