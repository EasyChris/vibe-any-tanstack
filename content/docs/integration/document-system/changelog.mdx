VibeAny includes a built-in changelog feature that displays product updates in a timeline format, keeping users informed about new features and improvements.

## Directory Structure

Changelog entries are stored in the `content/changelog/` directory:

```bash
content/changelog/

├── initial-release.zh.mdx   # Chinese version
├── v1.1.0.mdx
└── v1.1.0.zh.mdx
```

## Creating a Changelog Entry

Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/changelog/` directory:

```mdx title="content/changelog/v1.1.0.mdx"
---

### Frontmatter Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Yes | Update title |

## Multi-language Support

The changelog supports multiple languages, distinguished by file suffix:

- `v1.1.0.zh.mdx` — Chinese version

## Display

The changelog page route is `/changelog`, displayed as a timeline of all published updates:

- Sorted by date in descending order, newest updates at the top
- Displays version number labels
- Supports MDX rich text content
- Responsive layout, mobile-friendly

## Writing Guidelines

To make the changelog clear and readable, follow these conventions:

### Use Semantic Categories

```markdown
## New Features
- Added xxx feature

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed xxx issue

## Improvements
- Optimized xxx performance

## Breaking Changes
- xxx API has been deprecated, please use yyy instead
```

### Write for Users

Describe changes in language that users can understand, not technical jargon:

```markdown
❌ Refactored AuthService dependency injection logic
✅ Improved login flow, now 50% faster
```

## Customizing Styles

The changelog page uses the following components, which you can customize in the corresponding files:

- Timeline container: `src/shared/components/changelog/timeline.tsx`
- Timeline item: `src/shared/components/changelog/timeline-item.tsx`
- MDX extras: `src/shared/components/changelog/mdx-extras.tsx`
