VibeAny includes a complete blog system built on [fumadocs-mdx](https://fumadocs.dev/docs/mdx), making it easy to write and manage blog posts.

## Directory Structure

Blog-related content is stored in the `content` directory:

```bash
content/
├── blog/                    # Blog posts
│   ├── my-first-post.mdx    # English post
│   └── my-first-post.zh.mdx # Chinese post
├── authors/                 # Author information
│   └── vibe-any.mdx
└── categories/              # Post categories
    ├── company.mdx
    └── product.mdx
```

## Creating a Blog Post

Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/blog/` directory:

```mdx title="content/blog/hello-world.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
description: My first blog post
image: /images/blog/hello-world.png  # Cover image (optional)
date: 2026-02-01T00:00:00Z
published: true                       # Set to false to hide
categories: [product]                 # Categories
author: vibe-any                      # Author
tags: [nextjs, tutorial]              # Tags
---

Here is the body content, supporting all MDX syntax...
```

### Frontmatter Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Yes | Post title |
| `description` | string | No | Post description for SEO and list display |
| `image` | string | No | Cover image URL |
| `date` | string | Yes | Publication date, ISO 8601 format |
| `published` | boolean | Yes | Whether to publish |
| `categories` | string[] | No | Category ID array |
| `author` | string | No | Author ID |

## Multi-language Support

The blog supports multiple languages, distinguished by file suffix:

- `my-post.mdx` — English version (default)
- `my-post.zh.mdx` — Chinese version

The system automatically loads the corresponding language version based on the current locale.

## Managing Authors

Create author files in the `content/authors/` directory:

```mdx title="content/authors/john.mdx"
---
name: John Doe
avatar: /images/authors/john.png
twitter: johndoe
---

Author bio goes here...
```

Then reference the author in blog posts with `author: john`.

## Managing Categories

Create category files in the `content/categories/` directory:

```mdx title="content/categories/tutorial.mdx"
---
title: Tutorial
description: Technical tutorial articles
---
```

Then reference the category in blog posts with `categories: [tutorial]`.

## Accessing the Blog

Blog page routes are:

- List page: `/blog`
- Detail page: `/blog/[slug]`

Users can filter posts by category and click post cards to read the full article.

## Customizing Styles

The blog pages use the following components, which you can customize in the corresponding files:

- Blog grid: `src/shared/components/blog/blog-grid.tsx`
- Blog card: `src/shared/components/blog/blog-card.tsx`
- Post content: `src/shared/components/blog/custom-mdx-content.tsx`
