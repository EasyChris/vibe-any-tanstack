description: Render a Kanban-style roadmap using JSON configuration and reusable components, with multi-language support
---

VibeAny includes a built-in product roadmap feature that displays product planning in a Kanban format, keeping users informed about upcoming features and current development progress.

## Directory Structure

Roadmap configuration is stored in the `content/roadmap/` directory:

```bash
content/roadmap/
├── config.en.json    # English configuration
└── config.zh.json    # Chinese configuration
```

## Configuration Format

The roadmap uses JSON format, structured as follows:

```json title="content/roadmap/config.en.json"
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "title": "Planned",
      "icon": "Calendar",
      "color": "#60A5FA",
      "items": [
        {
          "title": "Feature Name",
          "description": "Feature description"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "In Progress",
      "icon": "Loader",
      "color": "#F59E0B",
      "items": []
    },
    {
      "title": "Launched",
      "icon": "Rocket",
      "color": "#34D399",
      "items": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Field Reference

#### Column

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Yes | Column title, e.g., "Planned", "In Progress", "Launched" |
| `icon` | string | Yes | Lucide icon name |
| `color` | string | Yes | Column theme color, hex color value |
| `items` | array | Yes | Array of feature items in this column |

#### Item

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | string | Yes | Feature name |
| `description` | string | Yes | Feature description |

### Available Icons

Icons use [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/). Common icons include:

- `Calendar` — Calendar, for "Planned"
- `Loader` — Loading, for "In Progress"
- `Rocket` — Rocket, for "Launched"
- `CheckCircle` — Check mark, for "Completed"
- `Clock` — Clock, for "Waiting"
- `Star` — Star, for "Featured"

## Multi-language Support

The roadmap supports multiple languages through separate configuration files:

- `config.en.json` — English version
- `config.zh.json` — Chinese version

The system automatically loads the corresponding configuration file based on the current language.

## Display

The roadmap page route is `/roadmap`, displayed as a three-column Kanban board:

- Responsive layout, automatically switches to single column on mobile
- Each column displays an icon and color indicator
- Feature cards show title and description

## Customizing Column Count

The default uses a three-column layout (Planned, In Progress, Launched). You can adjust the number of columns as needed by adding or removing elements in the `columns` array.

```json title="Four-column layout example"
{
  "columns": [
    { "title": "Ideas", "icon": "Lightbulb", "color": "#A78BFA", "items": [] },
    { "title": "Planned", "icon": "Calendar", "color": "#60A5FA", "items": [] },
    { "title": "In Progress", "icon": "Loader", "color": "#F59E0B", "items": [] },
    { "title": "Launched", "icon": "Rocket", "color": "#34D399", "items": [] }
  ]
}
```

## Customizing Styles

The roadmap page uses the following components, which you can customize in the corresponding files:

- Board container: `src/shared/components/roadmap/board.tsx`
- Column component: `src/shared/components/roadmap/column.tsx`
- Card component: `src/shared/components/roadmap/item-card.tsx`
